Web services and APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are related concepts, but they differ in scope, implementation, and functionality. Hereâ€™s a detailed comparison:

### **Definition**

| **Aspect**              | **Web Service**                                                                                   | **API**                                                                                     |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**           | A **web service** is a software system designed to support interoperable communication over a network. | An **API** is a set of protocols, tools, and definitions that allow applications to interact with each other. |
| **Medium**               | Web services are accessible over a **network**, typically using the HTTP/HTTPS protocol.          | APIs can work over various protocols (e.g., HTTP, TCP, or in-memory communication).         |

### **Key Differences**

| **Feature**               | **Web Services**                                                                                 | **APIs**                                                                                   |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Dependency on the Web** | A web service is specifically designed for communication over the **internet or intranet**.      | An API is a broader concept and does not require a network. APIs can exist without the web.|
| **Transport Protocol**    | Uses **standard web protocols** like HTTP, SOAP, and REST.                                       | Can use **multiple protocols**, such as HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket, TCP, or local function calls.|
| **Format**                | Web services typically use **XML** (e.g., in SOAP) or **JSON** (e.g., in RESTful services).       | APIs can use any data format, such as JSON, XML, YAML, or binary.                          |
| **Scope**                 | A web service is a **specific type of API** that provides services over the web.                 | APIs are a broader concept, encompassing both web-based and non-web-based interactions.    |
| **Statefulness**          | Web services can be **stateful** (e.g., SOAP) or **stateless** (e.g., REST).                     | APIs can be stateful or stateless, depending on implementation.                            |
| **Technology Constraints**| Often constrained by **web protocols and technologies**.                                         | More flexible and not limited to web protocols.                                            |

### **Similarities**
1. **Interoperability**:
   - Both enable communication between software applications.
2. **Encapsulation**:
   - Both provide a way to abstract the underlying implementation details.
3. **Data Exchange**:
   - Both enable data exchange, often using formats like JSON or XML.

---

### **Examples**

#### Web Service:
- **SOAP** (Simple Object Access Protocol):
  - XML-based protocol for exchanging structured information.
  - Example: A currency conversion web service.

- **RESTful Web Service**:
  - Uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for operations.
  - Example: A weather forecast web service returning JSON data.

#### API:
- **Web API**:
  - Example: Google Maps API, which allows embedding maps and geolocation features into applications.

- **Non-Web API**:
  - Example: A database API like SQLite or file I/O APIs in programming languages.

### **When to Use Each**
| **Use Case**                             | **Web Service**                              | **API**                                       |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Communication between applications over the web | Ideal for interoperable services over HTTP/HTTPS. | Works as long as the protocol is supported.  |
| Local communication                      | Not applicable.                             | Suitable for local system-level operations.  |
| Protocol flexibility                     | Limited to web protocols (e.g., HTTP, SOAP). | Broader range of protocols and data formats. |

### **Summary**

- **All web services are APIs**, but not all APIs are web services.
- Web services are a specialized subset of APIs designed for **network-based communication**.
- APIs are broader and include both **web-based interactions (like web services)** and **non-web-based interactions** (e.g., file system APIs, OS APIs).
